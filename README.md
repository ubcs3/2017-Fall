## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.

### Fall 2017: Practical Data Science

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To practice data wrangling using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * To construct data visualizations using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
  * To build models and make predictions using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
  * To submit models and solutions to [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): datasets, competitions, and community
  * [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/): interactive data visualizations
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
  * [ubc.syzygy.ca](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/): Jupyter notebooks hosted by [PIMS](http://pims.math.ca/)
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Data wrangling
  * Data visualization
  * Machine learning
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * Calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
  * Basic Python (see [UBCS3 Summer 2016](https://github.com/ubcs3/2016-Summer))
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!
